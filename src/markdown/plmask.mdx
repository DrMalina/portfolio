import Abbr from '../components/Abbr.tsx';

First commercial task Iâ€™ve done - a multi-page website for a company selling protective masks in Poland. I used this project as an opportunity to learn Gatsby.js and try out some new CSS framework - Tailwind CSS. The site uses headless <Abbr title='Content Management System' text='CMS'/> for the owner to manage the company's products.
