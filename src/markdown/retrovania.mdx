import Abbr from '../components/Abbr.tsx';

The goal of the project was to build an old games rental service using <Abbr title='MongoDB, Express, React, Node' text='MERN'/> stack. It was created as part of a SoftServe IT Academy workshop that I have participated in. My responsibilities varied accordingly from frontend to backend - among other things, I was for example charged with authentication's logic in Redux or games filtering on both ends of the app. The project is not available to view in a live version, although feel free to checkout the code itself.
