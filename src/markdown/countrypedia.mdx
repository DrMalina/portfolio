import Abbr from '../components/Abbr.tsx';

<p>
  <Abbr title="Single Page Application" text="SPA" /> displaying data about countries from around
  the world. User is able to search and filter countries along with viewing the detailed information
  of each country on a separate page. Throughout the project I wanted to experiment and get some
  experience with the Material-UI framework + Typescript.
